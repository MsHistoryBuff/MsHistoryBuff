- 👋 Hi, I’m @MsHistoryBuff
- 👀 I’m interested in all historical scholarship.  I try to keep up by listening to history-related podcasts (I am currently listening to Project 1619), watching 
historical fictions movies (PBS is a good source), or documentaries.  I love to cook and try out new recipes, borrowing ideas and flavors from around the world.  I am mainly influenced by Mediterranean
cuisine.  I am slowly trying to convince myself to get back into a regular workout routine since going full-time work from home. 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning all things GitHub, working with the amazing Commercial Legal team.  I am also taking a contracts law class as part of the CA Paralegal Certification Program. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Legal Operations and Commercial Legal Projects. 
- 📫 How to reach me by dropping a DM in Slack, or email: mshistorybuff@github.com
